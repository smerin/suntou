      <h2>Kora player, multi instrumentalist, producer, composer.</h2>
      <p>
        Born a Griot in a 700-year old tradition, the Kora - harp-lute with 22
        strings - is unique to the Griots of the Mandinka people. Griots have a
        unique societal role as oral historians, transmitting and preserving a
        people's culture through the generations in song, music and poetry.

        attention as soon as he arrived on the UK music scene.
